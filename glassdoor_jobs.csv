Developer Experience (DevX) is dedicated to making Bloomberg's Engineers productive, efficient and agile using state-of-the-art development and deployment tooling. Our teams bring together the talent we need to build the best tools, and we are constantly working to improve on the overall developer experience: from writing code, building, linking, linting, and testing all the way to deployment.

The Build Solutions London team within DevX is developing the next generation of build tooling and infrastructure at Bloomberg. Currently, we are focused on providing a consistent experience when building software on a developer's laptop or a production build cluster. Our aim is that any developer should be able to pick up any new project, and start being productive as quickly as possible, without worrying about how to set up a build environment.

What we're working on:
At present, we are primarily focused on delivering a new workflow tool called - Berg. We want Berg to be THE user-facing tool for building software at Bloomberg. The aim of Berg is to gradually move Bloomberg projects towards declarative build configuration, and provide a uniform way of building software, whether you are building on a laptop, a CI server or a remote build farm. As part of Berg, we want to offer high performance, correct and repeatable builds to all our developers.

Our team is amongst the leaders of open source projects like BuildStream (https://buildstream.build/), and regularly participate in related meetups and conferences. Working with such open source projects is a core part of our work. So, we are very proud to say that our work not only improves the developer experience for Bloomberg, but also for the wider community.

Our primary motivation with projects like BuildStream and Berg is to ensure that all software in the company can be built and depended upon in a reliable manner.

Besides our core projects, every member of our team gets 20% X-time to work on projects that may not be a part of our sprint work otherwise. You can use this time to learn about new technologies, create a new prototype, collaborate with inner source projects, or start a new one!

Who are you?

An engineer who is excited by the challenge of creating a build system for over 5,000 developers. You are someone who is interested in build workflows, build systems and the performance of both. You're passionate about working with the open source community and using the right tool for the job.

We'll trust you to:
Design and improve tools and workflows that help our engineers build and test code
Collaborate with engineers across Bloomberg and the tech community to ensure our build system meets their various needs
Work with other DevX teams in order to deliver a consistent experience to our users
Research and prototype new build platforms and keep up to date with industry trends

You'll need to have:
Experience with or interest in Python
Experience designing and developing large distributed systems
Experience using Linux/Unix
Experience collaborating with stakeholders from multiple teams
A team-player attitude

Senior Software Engineer,£71K-£110K (Glassdoor Est.),"Description

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even setup to on-board any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are setup to continue remotely as well :)

---------------------------

NOTE: We currently have no open roles at this level for Manchester at this time. We review our requirements frequently and would encourage you to register your interest for this role. You will receive a response from and we'll keep you posted on upcoming live roles at this level :)

Salary range is £45,900 - £63,000 per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Senior Software Engineers are senior contributors to digital, data and technology outcomes that improve society. They do this by delivering and architecting software, and coaching others to do so in public sector organisations, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Senior Software Engineers find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Software Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

A word from us


Everybody likes to say they’re different...

Newton was founded to buck the norm in management consultancy - to demand better for its clients. Because, for us, change doesn’t come from behind a laptop. It comes from getting under the skin of an organisation and learning first-hand how it ticks. It’s not about producing reports that gather dust on a boardroom’s top shelf; it’s about delivering results that actually work.We crack some of the biggest challenges that businesses and public sector organisations face.

We’re called upon to bring much-needed change, from redesigning social care to improving build efficiencies on aircraft carriers. The work’s varied and complex - just how we like it. And no one else does it quite like we do. Take our business model. We guarantee our fees against delivering results, and will only leave once our clients see those results stick. Bold - yes. Disruptive? Always.

Blindingly fast career progression means that if you show you’re ready to step up - you’ll be promoted. Because we recognise talent, not tenure. And with all the support, training, and development you need, there’s really no stopping you. No matter the role you join in, you’ll be surrounded by spirited, naturally curious people. People who want to learn from you, and who’ll also teach you a thing or two along the way. It’s how everyone goes further, faster.

Job description

Summary

We are looking for a motivated and high-achieving Software Engineer based in London to join the team on our vision to optimise every business on the planet. This is a full-time placement with significant opportunities for personal development.

We offer an intellectually stimulating environment, work within an interdisciplinary team and an inclusive culture. We are a high-calibre, mission-driven team building a technology that improves our world.

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

About Concentra


Concentra Analytics is a fast-growth SaaS product company with an award-winning, enterprise solution for workforce analysis and modelling.

In 2008, Rupert Morrison, CEO, and his core team of management consultants from A.T. Kearney joined with a software development house, Concentra Consulting, to form what became Concentra Analytics.

Fundamental to the company’s vision is the creation of a suite of SaaS-based products to disrupt the market. These solutions allow business leaders to visualise, analyse, model and address operational challenges through people analytics (OrgVue) and data warehousing (DataPlus).

Fast-forward to 2018, Concentra Analytics completes a £41 million growth equity investment to accelerate its international expansion and support the development of its market-leading, workforce analysis and planning product, OrgVue. Central to securing this investment is the aggressive growth of annuity sales of OrgVue licenses, globally.

Concentra employs 220+ employees and operates from London (HQ), Netherlands, Philadelphia and recently opened offices in Hong Kong and Australia. Concentra has partnerships for coverage in the Middle East, South Africa and other regions.

"Software Engineer, Model Engineering (Contract)",£71K-£110K (Glassdoor Est.),"Improbable has created SpatialOS: a networking solution combining low latency, tools for faster iteration, and a ready-to-go architecture capable of supporting innovative games.

Now the Improbable Defence division, building on the backbone of SpatialOS, has combined world class scientific modelling, market leading AI, mission specific user interfaces and a uniquely flexible and secure deployment model to create a powerful simulation platform tailored to the needs of the military.

Our mission? To enable the most realistic and effective military simulations ever experienced, making defence users more effective on operations and decreasing the cost of military preparedness.


Your Mission
...is to build scientific models that support our entire product offering and facilitate next generation decision support. We are a friendly, relaxed & inclusive team with an ambition to take agent-based modelling to the next level. Unlike many teams, we are a mix of applied scientists and software engineers working very collaboratively both internally and with our Defence customers.

We build software models of social systems as goal-oriented actors operating on imperfect information, “digitally twin” physical environments and infrastructure, and obsess with modularity to recast complex systems as combinations of simpler systems. Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.

***This is an initial 6 month contract to join an existing team & project***
Your Impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.
You will be building socio-technical models of real-world phenomena that allow our customers to better understand how individuals interact with physical, political, information and other systems.
Your work will help military tacticians understand situations and plan more effectively, ultimately helping add to the stability and security of the world.
If you identify with the following, we'd love to chat:
You are an experienced software engineer with fluency in at least one relevant OO or functional programming language and the openness to learn and adapt to a variety of languages. We currently use Python and C++ a lot as well as many of the related tools and libraries.
You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role.

Equal Opportunity
The best ideas are often the least expected and require new ways of thinking; that’s why our teams at Improbable are made up of an incredible range of talented people.

Python Software Engineer,£71K-£110K (Glassdoor Est.),"Streetbees is a tech start-up that is transforming how companies can gain insights into the markets for their products, to make better products that better provide for the needs of their customers. We are using machine learning and software engineering to create faster, lower cost, higher quality and more automated ways to gather information from people around the world, and to understand the patterns, trends and opinions.
Streetbees has a very strong engineering team and platform, combining the best in machine learning, data management pipelines, web platforms and mobile apps. We work with Python for our data science and machine learning, Ruby and Elixir with ReactJS for our web apps and APIs and middleware, and Swift and Kotlin (our Android codebase is 100% Kotlin). Everything is entirely hosted in AWS, all repos in Github, everything containerised.
An opportunity exists for a Python Software Engineer to join our team, particularly those who have enthusiasm to work at the intersection of scalable distributed web platforms with data engineering and machine learning technologies. This is the core of Streetbees technology activities as a leading ‘applied AI’ company - it is one of the most exciting frontiers of modern technology, where new types of software are emerging, and new capabilities that were simply not possible a few years ago are now being created. We are looking for enthusiast to contribute to building something truly great in this space.
The Python Software Engineer will have strong technical and software engineering knowledge relative to their years of experience, so that they are able to make a major contribution to creating production-quality AI solutions. We are looking for engineers at both mid and senior experience levels as we are more driven by a colleagues contribution and skills than length of service, and as a fast growing start-up we have flexibility in exact skills requirements in order to build the best team. Successful candidates will probably have either significant data engineering (e.g. PySpark, Airflow, Pandas etc), or web app engineering (e.g. Django, Flask etc) backgrounds, or another background where Python is a leading tool for engineering purposes.
This is a fully hands on position. Any experience with machine learning engineering using Tensorflow, Keras and PyTorch would be a large advantage, but is not required if someone has strong Python software engineering knowledge in another of the common Python use cases (e.g. web development and data engineering). This is not a role for a pure data engineer or data scientist though, it is a software engineering role and would particularly suit engineers who have significant experience outside of machine learning and a self-motivated interest in developing expertise in machine learning engineering, as a means to produce the new generations of software capability now possible by combining machine learning aspects with established engineering approaches.

Role Responsibilities
Hands-on design, development and support of world class production Python solutions, both web application and machine learning. Contribution to standards about production-quality engineering and QA for Python solutions. Active pull request participation, branch management, other code reviews of other Python developers work etc.
Working with our DevOps team for production Machine Learning AI solutions (DevOps for machine learning is a new area for the industry, with little current conventional best practice, Streetbees expertise in ML creates a real opportunity to do leading-edge DevOps work productionising that). Working with the other engineers to define how Python software engineering should be done
Development and support of data engineering platform, Python web applications and APIs, and machine learning platforms, all on AWS including using specialist ML accelerators
Being an active part of the group of engineers reviewing and making key tech design decisions, and coordinating work and operations
Keeping up to date with the latest evolutions in Python software engineering best practice and technologies
Requirements
Excellent Python knowledge and skills relative to level of experience, including both Python language technicalities, and the technical underpinnings of the Python platform, in particular including maintainability, performance and reliability
Years of commercial experience building and supporting large scale web, app and API platforms with Python relative to experience
Experienced with the AWS application suite (bonus points if you have experience with DevOps technologies around it such as Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform)
Experienced with relational, but also NOSQL, databases (bonus points for Postgres specifically). The more knowledge of data processing, vectorisation and machine learning frameworks the better.
Experience with requirements specification, Python testing tools, with software design patterns, with Agile development processes
Benefits

At Streetbees, your company benefits will include:
A 24-day paid holiday allowance with the option to rollover up to 3 days per year
Option to choose between a Mac or a PC (we will send this out to via courier a few days before you join!)
Flexible working hours - we trust people to manage their time and to focus on wider results; We now operate on a rota basis so people have access to the office. We have taken every precaution to keep COVID-19 secure. The health and safety of our team is of the utmost importance.

To work in a unique and exclusive high technology test facility, integrating and testing missile hardware in a dynamic environment providing a critical test capability to MBDA and our customers.

You would be part of a small, multi-skilled team, doing complex technical work and experiencing a wide variety of technologies and engineering disciplines. The UK HWIL team is part of a wider, integrated, international HWIL team conducting similar activities in France and Italy, where sharing of knowledge, tools and techniques is strongly promoted.

Hardware In The Loop (HWIL) work is predominantly ‘hands on’ with real missile equipment and sophisticated test facilities. The role of the team involves designing, developing and using closed loop HWIL simulations to investigate and prove the behaviours and performance of MBDAs products over a range of different conditions to ensure high confidence in the operation of our products. HWIL testing forms a critical part of the missile design and development cycle, where testing is focussed on understanding and investigating product characteristics and behaviours, often with prototype equipment and cutting edge technologies, not simply testing on a production line.

What are we looking for?

Essential:

•Strong ability and experience of software development, ideally using C, C++ or similar

•Experience developing within the Linux environment.

•Good problem solving skills

•Be pro-active and be capable of working on their own initiative with minimum supervision

•Able to work with varied engineering teams

Desirable:

•Experience of Integrating hardware and software.

•Experience with multi-threaded software products.

•Experience of driver level software development.

•Experience using Matlab/Simulink

•Understanding of real time computing systems

•Understanding of mathematical modelling concepts

•Ability to visualise and analyse complex systems

What’s in it for you?
Exposure to new challenges giving continual opportunities for growth and problem solving
Experience of working in a diverse engineering environment with exposure to many different engineering skills and activities, giving lots of opportunities for learning
Working closely with specialists both within HWIL and specialist engineers across MBDA both nationally and internationally
Working with real equipment, not just a desk job
Opportunities to gain deep knowledge of how MBDA products work by testing them as a system.
The Role
This role focuses on design, implementation and support to software items used within the HWIL facility. These software items vary between software to control mathematical models with input/output interfaces in real time through to software for performing data analysis and visualisation.
This role will also provide the opportunity to work 'hands on' with sophisticated test equipment and missile hardware. Unlike many COTS real time Hardware in the Loop software products, MBDA produces it's own Linux PC based toolsets as our needs go well beyond any COTS products currently available.
What’s great about the team?

A relatively small, highly experienced, multi skilled team, renowned for delivering critical testing for MBDA

The team are highly pro-active and passionate about the work that they do. The team has a strong problem solving approach to work, where a real difference can be made by everybody in the team. Opportunity to develop “hands on” and practical engineering solutions from the varied skills within the team who offer a high level of support to each other.

What would you get?

Competitive salary, flexible working, paid overtime (subject to level), a comprehensive pension scheme, employee funded voluntary private healthcare, sporting activities, fantastic site facilities, bonus schemes (subject to level), superb learning and development opportunities and more….

MBDA is committed to providing an inclusive working environment where our employees can be themselves and everyone has equal opportunity to reach their full potential.

After that, sits take place as a trust-based, money-free exchange that sees owners enjoy worry-free travel while our sitters enjoy the company of pets and unlock a world of unique accommodation.

You will contribute code reviews, support and mentoring to other members of the squad, to help them accomplish team goals.

We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

We’re building a credit bureau the right way - with the customer involved and transparent throughout. We’re looking for talented and creative engineers who share our vision.

We’re looking for people who want to learn and grow; if that sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you.

We work closely together as a company

We’re a small team with a big vision, so no-one specialises too much - we wear many hats week-to-week. We’re grappling with a large problem so there are plenty of challenges to be faced but we face them one weekly sprint at a time. Your role here would see you working with the founders of the company and the rest of the team on a wide range of issues to bring our vision of a better credit bureau to reality.

You can work with a host of great technologies

Golang and Ruby on Rails for our core applications and APIs
Python for our data processing + science
TypeScript with React and Redux for most of our front-end flows

would like to be engaged in meaningful work
are keen to learn and develop their skills and knowledge
are comfortable bottoming out problems in open discussion
are interested in building a data-oriented company
love writing elegant and well-tested software
have some experience with distributed systems

What we value:
Motivation, enthusiasm and passion for our mission to take on the big credit bureaus
Expansive thinking, transparency, honesty and a good sense of humour

Software Engineer,£52K-£77K (Glassdoor Est.),"About Admiral

Admiral Group is a FTSE 100 Financial Services company with a presence in eight countries. The company was set up in 1993 as a car insurance specialist, but since then the Group has expanded in other countries and other insurance verticals such as household and travel insurance, in loans, price comparison platforms, and has developed innovative products.

The Group has 7 million customers worldwide and employs over 11,000 people across its operations. Admiral is a growth story with an enviable track record of strong financial performances, ROE consistently over 50%, a turnover of £3.5 bn, and a profit before tax of £520 m in 2019.

Admiral’s philosophy is that ‘people who like what they do, do it better’ and Admiral is proud to offer an open culture where achievement is rewarded and recognised and where coming to work is exciting every day. In 2019, Admiral received a special award from ‘Best Companies to Work For’ as the only company to feature within their rankings since they began 20 years ago: a true testament to the Group’s culture.

About Veygo

Veygo is an independent company built and owned by Admiral operating within the Admiral Pioneer business.

Admiral Pioneer is a new business within Admiral Group with the objective of seeding, launching, and scaling new businesses that will become one of the growth engines for Admiral in the future. These new businesses will anchor around meeting customer needs in growth areas. We will achieve this by experimenting and proving new products, business models, and partnerships.

Veygo is one of these new businesses and at the forefront of the Mobility as a Service (MaaS) revolution, providing transport solutions for customers with and without cars. We want to make life easier for those wishing to share cars, use their own temporarily, or for learner drivers looking to practice in a family member’s or friends’ car. In short, we want to help people be able to get behind the wheel of a car, even if they don’t own one.

Our journey started in 2016 and it has been a challenging and exciting few years to disrupt the sector and show that tech allows us to provide great products, and in a way that is in line with the modern-day lifestyle. We are building a dynamic and energizing environment where we will provide all the excitement and freedom of a scale-up but with the support and stability of an established large organisation. We treat our colleagues openly, equally, and fairly and give them a ton of opportunity and freedom to do their best work and make a positive impact. We make mistakes because building from scratch is not easy but we are curious about where we get it wrong and we take this learning forward.

As of today, we have a strong team of 60, but with a clear idea of where we want to go in the next few years, we need to strengthen it to keep pushing forward. We seek to recruit bright, passionate people who have a can-do attitude who look at the world and see the opportunity in our own small way, to make it better for our customers.

Engineering at Veygo

We see ourselves as a tech start-up, and so engineering is at the heart of Veygo and the driving force behind everything. We have 14 engineers at Veygo, with varying backgrounds and experience which gives us a great platform to be creative and find solutions, with the customer at the heart of our process. We are looking to grow our engineering team to 20… maybe you could be one of them!

We’re passionate about building great software, using modern technologies, following industry best practices, and have a mantra of win or learn. We don’t have (and don’t want to have) arbitrary experience or qualifications requirements as we would then just be ticking boxes and that’s not what we do. We currently have several non-graduates and people who studied unrelated degrees on the team who are invaluable… as long as you’re passionate and enthusiastic, we’d love to chat with you.

Who We’re Looking For

We’re currently looking for two mid-level engineers to join the team.

What You’ll Be Doing

All of our engineers are full-stack: we have no time for knowledge silos and we do everything we can to make sure our engineers can work on anything and everything. A typical day in engineering can mean creating infrastructure using Terraform, debugging the inner-workings of one of our Python applications, or writing a shiny new React component for use in our quote engine.

We’re a tech start-up, not an established insurance brand - this means the pace is fast, the days are varied, but the work is energetic and very rewarding. You can expect to collaborate with other departments across the brand from marketing to customer service, and data to claims.

We’d love to speak to you regardless of experience or the technologies you’ve worked with, but you should definitely apply if you can:

Develop back-end services, ideally using Python and Django

Develop modern front-end apps, ideally using TypeScript , React and Redux

Design REST APIs

Deploy your code to production and support it, ideally on AWS

Champion best practices like automated testing and continuous deployment

Play an active role in agile ceremonies like retrospectives and sprint planning

Benefits

Pension

Share scheme for all employees after a year

One self-development day per month

Three days flexi per year

Veygo team days (better than it sounds!)

Salary, Benefits and Work-Life Balance

We do not have a set salary for this position, as it will be dependent on the successful candidate’s experience. We are happy to see CVs from all candidates who meet the requirements and will be happy to discuss the remuneration package.

At Admiral, we are proud to be a diverse business where we put our people and customers first. We have great benefits to ensure employees have a great work-life balance; it's one of the reasons we're voted no. 1 in the 2019 Sunday Times Best Big Companies to Work For in the UK. We want you to have an element of freedom to define a working lifestyle that supports this, so accommodate flexible hours wherever possible.

Software Engineer,£31K-£36K (Glassdoor Est.),"It's a brave new world & the future path isn't obvious. With that said we're happy to be transparent with you about the state of play here at ThoughtWorks!

For now, we're looking after our own. We know all too well how quickly that changes & therefore want to open up the opportunity for you to register your interest in what we do here.

You may be ghosted for a few weeks post applying & we know that's not cool. We want your first impressions of us to be a fair representation of us at our best, so we may wait to engage you when the opportunity here is a reality. We hope you agree with that approach :)

ThoughtWorks is a global software consultancy. Our developers have been contributing code to major organisations and open source projects for over 25 years. They've also been writing books, speaking at conferences and helping push software development forward, changing companies and even industries along the way.

As consultants, we work onsite with our clients to ensure we're evolving their technology and empowering adaptive mindsets to meet their business goals. You could influence the digital strategy of a retail giant (timely!), build a bold new mobile application for a bank or redesign platforms using event sourcing and intelligent data pipelines.

You will use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

For a team to thrive, it needs active collaboration and room for healthy, respectful debate. Senior Developers are the technologists who cultivate this environment while driving teams toward delivering on an ambitious tech vision and acting as mentors for more junior-level consultants. They leverage their deep technical knowledge to solve more complex business problems and actively assess their team's health, code quality and nonfunctional pipelines.

You'll spend time on the following:
You will use continuous delivery practices to deliver high-quality software as well as value to end customers as early as possible.
You will work in collaborative, value-driven teams to build innovative customer experiences for our clients
Create large-scale distributed systems out of microservices
You will apply the latest technology thinking from our tech radar to solve client problems
Efficiently utilise DevOps tools and practices to build and deploy software
You will lead or take part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery from ideation to deployment and everything in between
You will act as a mentor for less-experienced peers through both your technical knowledge and leadership skills
Here's what we're looking for:
You have substantial experience with two or more development languages such as Java, JavaScript or C#.
You can skillfully write high-quality, well-tested code and you are comfortable with Object-Oriented programming
Presence in the external tech community: you proactively share your expertise with others via speaking engagements, contributions to open source, blogs and more
Comfortability with Agile methods, such as Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum and/or Kanban
You enjoy influencing others and always advocate for technical excellence while being open to change when needed
You're willing and able to commit to travel to client sites in order to solve their business problems
You're resilient in ambiguous situations and can approach challenges from multiple perspectives
Bonus points if you have working knowledge of cloud technology such as AWS, Azure, Kubernetes and Docker
We offer amazing benefits from the day you start including private medical insurance, travel insurance, income protection, critical illness, life assurance, pension scheme, child care vouchers, personal development budget, 25 days holiday and a ride2work scheme.

We proudly, passionately and actively strive to make both ThoughtWorks and our industry more representative of the communities we serve. We promote diversity in all its forms and reject discrimination and inequality.

Our diversity and award winning culture inspires our thought leaders and serves to nurture and develop amazing ideas. We believe this makes us a world leading destination of choice for all technologists.

We're also passionate about delivering quality by ensuring the most valuable use of our talents and experience. We aim to support different working patterns to ensure a diverse collective of people can call ThoughtWorks their home so if you're looking to work with high profile clients, delivering digital transformation and innovation, get in touch and chat to us about working flexibly!

About Cuvva

Cuvva is a new kind of insurance that’s fast, friendly, and flexible.

We get it - insurance doesn’t sound exciting. But this isn’t insurance as you know it. It’s insurance the way it should be. We’re putting the customer first and building products that solve real human needs.

We were the first company in the UK to sell hourly insurance, and the first to sell insurance through an app. We’ve sold over 1 million policies. We’ve written over 260,000 lines of code. And we’re a fast-growing team of over 70 talented people.

Why work for Cuvva?

We’re shaping the future of insurance. So we don’t cut corners. We try to do the right thing, even when that makes life more difficult for us.

We’ll speak up when we have an idea - but we know when to let go and get behind something else.

And we’re comfortable giving and receiving honest feedback, and trying new ways of doing things. It’s the Cuvva way.

We’re building a diverse team with different backgrounds, outlooks and experiences. So we give everyone a fair chance of getting a role at Cuvva. Even if you secretly don’t love insurance. (Don’t worry - we didn’t either.)

And if you need any adjustments or support when you’re applying to Cuvva, no worries. Just let us know.

As well as a competitive salary (£75-90k, dependent on experience) and equity based remuneration, benefits of working at Cuvva include:

Equality

We’re committed to ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to join Cuvva, whatever your background. We will always treat your application in a fair and equal manner.

About the role

We're looking for a software engineer who has held senior positions in engineering teams within high-growth, high-scale startups, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability and availability. You care deeply about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record of delivering solutions which support your team and your product.

You will develop Cuvva's core platform, abstracting the key processes required to sell insurance, delivering solutions that allow the team to develop strong and stable products, without having to spend time ensuring they get the basics right.

Aside from developing core platform services, we expect you will also become heavily involved with ops and security activities, contributing towards the maintenance of our servers, AWS account, etc.

""Core platform""

When we refer to the ""core platform"", we mean the services which underpin the processes of all insurance activities on our system.

For example, we expect one of these to be the ""policy service"", which might be responsible for ensuring compliant issuance of policies, coordinating mid-term adjustments, preventing overlapping policies (double insurance), etc.

Other services could include user authentication, risk & pricing calculation, handling the process of modifying user data in-line with any mid-term adjustment requirements.

All services we consider to be part of the core platform will have strict requirements around stability, data integrity and transactional safety. All functionality must fail safely and explicitly, for example using 2-phase commit processes or other similar techniques. This will also require a reasonable level of testing to validate this safety.

The perfect addition to our team will have:
a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
5+ years' commercial experience working on back-end systems at high-scale startups
at least a year of commercial experience working with Go
strong knowledge of security practices, ideally with a slightly grey-hat background
a working knowledge of the entire web stack - from how DNS lookups are transmitted, to how browsers prioritize CSS rules
awareness of compliance and financial regulation
We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!",4.3,"Cuvva

Who we are

The Osirium PxM Platform protects privileged accounts by connecting the right people to the right devices with the least privilege account and at the right time. It automates and delegates tasks to reduce costs and records sessions for compliance and accountability.

We’re an innovative UK company taking on giants where everybody contributes to making a big difference. We care about every customer, we care about our security, and we care about getting things done as a team. The company is a fun place to work, with a challenging problem space.

What we do

Essentially, each user has a login on the PxM platform and the platform knows how to login and interact with devices and applications, so it can proxy interactive connections; or run automated or user-initiated tasks.

We can natively proxy SSH, RDP, telnet, SFTP, HTTP(S) and MSSQL, and we also have MAP servers for exposing Windows-based thick clients via RDP.

Our process is reasonably agile, we keep meetings to a minimum, and we score a rising 9-ish on the Joel test and we’re working on that.

Our tech stack

We have a broad tech stack and we’re not expecting you to be an expert in everything!

Ubuntu is at the heart of our software appliance
Python for our server backend. We rely on Twisted, SQLAlchemy and Celery
Postgres and Redis for data persistence
C#, WiX and NSIS for our desktop client and MAP Server
Nginx + Ruby on Rails + Smartclient for our UI
C for RDP proxying (XRDP-based)
wxWidgets
HAProxy for proxying and multiplexing TCP connections
Git for SCM and Jenkins for CI
make, Docker, dh-virtualenv, equivs-build and debhelper for our build system
Ansible and vSphere for our infrastructure-as-code
What we're looking for

We would like an inspiring engineer who is comfortable and capable of effecting change at the whole-system level. We run cross-functional teams and your day-to-day will mostly be within the server backend but you’ll frequently find yourself traversing the stack. Sometimes, you might go out to a customer site to check out a problem firsthand.

You’ll have the exciting opportunity to work on and shape a complex system where resource constraints matter. You’ll have a high degree of autonomy and supportive colleagues.

We would like you to bring experience in a few of the following areas:

Working with scale in mind
Decoupling and distributing systems
Testing
Mentoring
Code reviewing
Requirements

Python is at the core of our tech stack and is a key skill. Beyond that, we’d like to see some outstanding ability in a few of the other items from the tech stack or experience list and an eagerness to learn!

You probably should have at least some interest in security – you don’t need to be an expert but you do need to care.

Applying

If you believe you have the right skills and wish to develop your expertise in cyber-security, this unique opportunity working for a UK creator of world beating software is worth a conversation. If you would like to be considered at this exciting time of our development and global expansion, send me your CV along with some code samples you’re proud of, andy.harris@osirium.com",5.0,"Osirium

Software Engineer,£36K-£51K (Glassdoor Est.),"About Koodoo

Koodoo is a new financial technology business that is shaking up the world of mortgages. The mortgage market is undergoing a major shift, with much more emphasis being placed on consumer choice, transparency and the role for new technology. Backed by the UK's leading digital venture builder (Blenheim Chalcot), Koodoo is building the technology to help connect customers seamlessly and intelligently with their next mortgage. We are working with some of the biggest names in financial services - comparison sites, marketplace providers, lenders - to deliver a better mortgage application and renewal experience to millions of borrowers in the UK.

About Blenheim Chalcot

Blenheim Chalcot has an unrivalled track record for building successful and disruptive digital ventures. Providing much more than just funds, businesses in the Blenheim Chalcot portfolio benefit from over 20 years of experience, knowledge, ideas and infrastructure. With offices in London, Nottingham, Edinburgh, New York and Mumbai, over 3000 employees, sales of over £300m, and a track record of building over 40 companies, the Blenheim Chalcot model aims to create an ""unfair advantage"" for its companies as they grow from ideas into multi-million pound, market-leading businesses. Companies in the portfolio, past and present, include Agilisys, TDX, ClearScore, Oakbrook Finance, Liberis and Salary Finance.

Koodoo's technology

We have developed a cloud-based, API-driven platform that connects mortgage customers with the best financial products for their needs. We push ourselves to use the best tools for the job - whether that's by using the latest technologies, leveraging the best of the open source ecosystem, or using tried and trusted development patterns. We are managing a 'true' microservices system architecture, using NodeJS, MongoDB, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, ReactJS and much more.

Our technology philosophy

At Koodoo, we believe that if something is worth building, it is worth building right. We embody the principles of agile in a way that works well for us as a business and we aren't afraid to evolve our thinking as the shape of our business changes. We base our development approach on SOLID principles, domain driven design patterns and clean code; we believe in creating systems that are built for continuous integration; we believe that all software should be built with a test-first approach, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and automation at the heart of the engineering team; we believe that DevOps and Reliability Engineering are full team responsibilities - a mindset, not a job title; we believe that software should be built for true continuous delivery (release early, release often). Furthermore, we believe that great software development teams should have a culture of mutual support, continuous learning, ownership… and fun!

The Role

You will be joining a software engineering team that takes quality seriously. You should bring that same passion for building the best software you can.

You will also have a passion for staying abreast of the latest developments in the software development landscape, and a personal ethic of continuous learning and self-improvement.
Even if you aren't well versed in every programming paradigm under the sun, you should have an appreciation for some of the different flavours and how to apply them
We build to a microservices architectural pattern built mostly around the NodeJS ecosystem (including frameworks similar to Express, React, Svelte, Joi), as well as spots of Python and Go.
You should be comfortable with data persistence technologies such as MongoDB, and redis.
While we favour a 'full stack' mindset, there will be opportunities for you to specialise in front end or back end development.
Even if you haven't yet had the opportunity to build them, you will understand the core principles of developing microservices, along with some of the pros and cons.
You will join a team that takes a measured approach to solution design with domain driven design principles at the core of our process.
As a small, focused team operating in a startup environment, we place a great emphasis on delivery and our ability to get new features live quickly, without compromising on quality, security or user experience.
We host our services in Docker containers, managed by Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, supported by rich automated testing and deployment pipelines.
As we consider DevOps to be a full team responsibility, it will be an advantage if you have experience of Continuous Delivery practices and toolchains, and ideally some hands-on experience with public cloud services.
We encourage a high degree of personal ownership, and all members of the team have the opportunity to contribute to the architectural design and the decision-making process.

If you recognise yourself in the above description, and the idea of working in a fast-paced, supportive and fun environment - where building code to a high standard is both expected and encouraged - then Koodoo is the place for you.

Software Engineer,£25K-£39K (Glassdoor Est.),"About Koodoo

Koodoo is a new financial technology business that is shaking up the world of mortgages. The mortgage market is undergoing a major shift, with much more emphasis being placed on consumer choice, transparency and the role for new technology. Backed by the UK's leading digital venture builder (Blenheim Chalcot), Koodoo is building the technology to help connect customers seamlessly and intelligently with their next mortgage. We are working with some of the biggest names in financial services - comparison sites, marketplace providers, lenders - to deliver a better mortgage application and renewal experience to millions of borrowers in the UK.

About Blenheim Chalcot

Blenheim Chalcot has an unrivalled track record for building successful and disruptive digital ventures. Providing much more than just funds, businesses in the Blenheim Chalcot portfolio benefit from over 20 years of experience, knowledge, ideas and infrastructure. With offices in London, Nottingham, Edinburgh, New York and Mumbai, over 3000 employees, sales of over £300m, and a track record of building over 40 companies, the Blenheim Chalcot model aims to create an ""unfair advantage"" for its companies as they grow from ideas into multi-million pound, market-leading businesses. Companies in the portfolio, past and present, include Agilisys, TDX, ClearScore, Oakbrook Finance, Liberis and Salary Finance.

Koodoo's technology

We have developed a cloud-based, API-driven platform that connects mortgage customers with the best financial products for their needs. We push ourselves to use the best tools for the job - whether that's by using the latest technologies, leveraging the best of the open source ecosystem, or using tried and trusted development patterns. We are managing a 'true' microservices system architecture, using NodeJS, MongoDB, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, CircleCI, ReactJS and much more.

Our technology philosophy

At Koodoo, we believe that if something is worth building, it is worth building right. We embody the principles of agile in a way that works well for us as a business and we aren't afraid to evolve our thinking as the shape of our business changes. We base our development approach on SOLID principles, domain driven design patterns and clean code; we believe in creating systems that are built for continuous integration; we believe that all software should be built with a test-first approach, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and automation at the heart of the engineering team; we believe that DevOps and Reliability Engineering are full team responsibilities - a mindset, not a job title; we believe that software should be built for true continuous delivery (release early, release often). Furthermore, we believe that great software development teams should have a culture of mutual support, continuous learning, ownership… and fun!

Benefits
Pension scheme (3% employer; 5% employee)
Flexible benefits package worth up to £800 a year (pro-rated in first year)

The Role
You will be joining a software engineering team that takes quality seriously. You should bring that same passion for building the best software you can.
You will have a strong focus on clean code, you will understand the value of software patterns and will favour test-first development.
You will also have a passion for staying abreast of the latest developments in the software development landscape, and a personal ethic of continuous learning and self-improvement.
Even if you aren't well versed in every programming paradigm under the sun, you should have an appreciation for some of the different flavours and how to apply them
We build to a microservices architectural pattern built mostly around the NodeJS ecosystem (including frameworks similar to Express, React, Svelte, Joi), as well as spots of Python and Go.
You should be comfortable with data persistence technologies such as MongoDB, and redis.
While we favour a 'full stack' mindset, there will be opportunities for you to specialise in front end or back end development.
Even if you haven't yet had the opportunity to build them, you will understand the core principles of developing microservices, along with some of the pros and cons.
You will join a team that takes a measured approach to solution design with domain driven design principles at the core of our process.
As a small, focused team operating in a startup environment, we place a great emphasis on delivery and our ability to get new features live quickly, without compromising on quality, security or user experience.
We host our services in Docker containers, managed by Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, supported by rich automated testing and deployment pipelines.
As we consider DevOps to be a full team responsibility, it will be an advantage if you have experience of Continuous Delivery practices and toolchains, and ideally some hands-on experience with public cloud services.
We encourage a high degree of personal ownership, and all members of the team have the opportunity to contribute to the architectural design and the decision-making process.
If you recognise yourself in the above description, and the idea of working in a fast-paced, supportive and fun environment - where building code to a high standard is both expected and encouraged - then Koodoo is the place for you. You will find yourself working with some of the smartest, and we like to think nicest, software professionals that you could ever hope to work with!",3.2,"AVADO

Who we are

The Osirium PxM Platform protects privileged accounts by connecting the right people to the right devices with the least privilege account and at the right time. It automates and delegates tasks to reduce costs and records sessions for compliance and accountability.

We’re an innovative UK company taking on giants where everybody contributes to making a big difference. We care about every customer, we care about our security, and we care about getting things done as a team. The company is a fun place to work, with a challenging problem space.

What we do

Essentially, each user has a login on the PxM platform and the platform knows how to login and interact with devices and applications, so it can proxy interactive connections; or run automated or user-initiated tasks.

We can natively proxy SSH, RDP, telnet, SFTP, HTTP(S) and MSSQL, and we also have MAP servers for exposing Windows-based thick clients via RDP.

Our process is reasonably agile, we keep meetings to a minimum, and we score a rising 9-ish on the Joel test and we’re working on that.

Our tech stack

We have a broad tech stack and we’re not expecting you to be an expert in everything!

Ubuntu is at the heart of our software appliance
Python for our server backend. We rely on Twisted, SQLAlchemy and Celery
Postgres and Redis for data persistence
C#, WiX and NSIS for our desktop client and MAP Server
Nginx + Ruby on Rails + Smartclient for our UI
C for RDP proxying (XRDP-based)
wxWidgets
HAProxy for proxying and multiplexing TCP connections
Git for SCM and Jenkins for CI
make, Docker, dh-virtualenv, equivs-build and debhelper for our build system
Ansible and vSphere for our infrastructure-as-code
What we're looking for

We would like an inspiring engineer who is comfortable and capable of effecting change at the whole-system level. We run cross-functional teams and your day-to-day will mostly be within the server backend but you’ll frequently find yourself traversing the stack. Sometimes, you might go out to a customer site to check out a problem firsthand.

You’ll have the exciting opportunity to work on and shape a complex system where resource constraints matter. You’ll have a high degree of autonomy and supportive colleagues.

We would like you to bring experience in a few of the following areas:

Working with scale in mind
Decoupling and distributing systems
Testing
Mentoring
Code reviewing
Requirements

Python is at the core of our tech stack and is a key skill. Beyond that, we’d like to see some outstanding ability in a few of the other items from the tech stack or experience list and an eagerness to learn!

You probably should have at least some interest in security – you don’t need to be an expert but you do need to care.

Applying

If you believe you have the right skills and wish to develop your expertise in cyber-security, this unique opportunity working for a UK creator of world beating software is worth a conversation.

Golang Software Engineer,£52K-£75K (Glassdoor Est.),"JOB DESCRIPTION

What you will do...


As a Software Engineer in the Gaming Transactions squad you will be responsible for building and running the transactions engine which underpins our customer facing products. This is a new and rapidly evolving service which is a key enabler for our platform strategy.

You'll be leading the way with the latest technologies including:
Go for our API backends
MySQL and Kafka for data storage and transport
Docker to containerise them
Jenkins to build them
Kubernetes to host them
Grafana and Prometheus to monitor them
It’s quite OK if some of the above is new to you, so long as you have an appetite and energy for imparting what you know, and learning what you don’t.

About you…


Engineering means more than authoring quality, tested code. It includes the end-to-end delivery pipeline; code driven deployment infrastructure; automated test safety nets; and effective operational instrumentation and incident response.

You’re a team player, who works collaboratively to achieve the shared squad goals. You are unafraid to challenge aspects outside your direct remit and passionately champion ‘the right thing’.

You’ll enjoy working in an architectural domain and you’re an advocate for sustainable software engineering; you strive for good technical design but don’t gold plate or prematurely abstract for a re-use that never materialises.

How you will do it…


Reporting into the Lead Software Engineer, you will:
Turn concepts and requirements into highly available web applications and systems using industry standard languages and technologies such as Go, Kafka, Docker, Prometheus, AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
Espouse the merits of idiomatic Go with a real passion for the language.
Actively participate in application and database design, data flows and detailed technical design. Ensure that analysis includes the wider view of technical and business impact.
Take ownership for code quality, security and scalability and have an equal grasp of the overall system you are working on and how it meets the needs of the end users, and business objectives.
Balance the commercial needs of the business against the ideal technical design, proposing sound phased or tactical implementations where appropriate.
Understand the importance of non-functionals such as real-time monitoring, good alert design and great logging strategies. Ensuring systems perform well to deliver the best user experience possible is something you consider as part of the normal delivery process.
Collaborate with other team members; learning from them, and in turn working with them to help them improve their own skills too.
Support the implementation of continuous integration to enhance deployment processes.
We are using virtual hiring and remote on-boarding to help our candidates and hiring managers stay safe. Face to face interactions will move over to video for this vacancy.

We base our development approach on SOLID principles, domain driven design patterns and clean code; we believe in creating systems that are built for continuous integration; we believe that all software should be built with a test-first approach, with a strong focus on performance, reliability, and automation at the heart of the engineering team; we believe that DevOps and Reliability Engineering are full team responsibilities - a mindset, not a job title; we believe that software should be built for true continuous delivery (release early, release often). Furthermore, we believe that great software development teams should have a culture of mutual support, continuous learning, ownership… and fun!

The Role

You will be joining a software engineering team that takes quality seriously. You should bring that same passion for building the best software you can.

You will also have a passion for staying abreast of the latest developments in the software development landscape, and a personal ethic of continuous learning and self-improvement.
Even if you aren't well versed in every programming paradigm under the sun, you should have an appreciation for some of the different flavours and how to apply them

We host our services in Docker containers, managed by Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, supported by rich automated testing and deployment pipelines.
As we consider DevOps to be a full team responsibility, it will be an advantage if you have experience of Continuous Delivery practices and toolchains, and ideally some hands-on experience with public cloud services.
We encourage a high degree of personal ownership, and all members of the team have the opportunity to contribute to the architectural design and the decision-making process.

Now the Improbable Defence division, building on the backbone of SpatialOS, has combined world class scientific modelling, market leading AI, mission specific user interfaces and a uniquely flexible and secure deployment model to create a powerful simulation platform tailored to the needs of the military.

Our mission? To enable the most realistic and effective military simulations ever experienced, making defence users more effective on operations and decreasing the cost of military preparedness.


Your Mission
...is to build scientific models that support our entire product offering and facilitate next generation decision support. We are a friendly, relaxed & inclusive team with an ambition to take agent-based modelling to the next level. Unlike many teams, we are a mix of applied scientists and software engineers working very collaboratively both internally and with our Defence customers.

We build software models of social systems as goal-oriented actors operating on imperfect information, “digitally twin” physical environments and infrastructure, and obsess with modularity to recast complex systems as combinations of simpler systems. Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.
Your Impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.
You will be building socio-technical models of real-world phenomena that allow our customers to better understand how individuals interact with physical, political, information and other systems.
Your work will help military tacticians understand situations and plan more effectively, ultimately helping add to the stability and security of the world.
If you identify with the following, we'd love to chat:
You are an experienced software engineer with fluency in at least one relevant OO or functional programming language and the openness to learn and adapt to a variety of languages. We currently use Python and C++ a lot as well as many of the related tools and libraries.
You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role.

Who are we?

Ometria is a customer marketing platform that helps e-commerce retailers make sense of their customer data. We use big data, predictive analytics and machine learning to help retailers send better, less generic and more personalised messages to their customers. We do this right now for some of the fastest growing retail brands, from Made.com to Hotel Chocolat and for 150 million individual people across the world.

We have offices in London, New York and Southampton, we have raised over £25M from leading VCs like Octopus and Summit and are scaling up the business and the platform. This is presenting many technical challenges in turn providing opportunity to learn, grow and develop. We are in the process of establishing a data centre in the US (New York) - so will be reproducing our infrastructure in a different AWS region.

On this journey to providing a product that really stands out we have grown a team of driven, self-reflective and dedicated Ometrians. We’re committed to finding potential candidates who can grow and flourish here, adding to the team culture.

What will you be doing?

As a Software Engineer, you will be working as part of our combined product and engineering team. You will work collaboratively to design scalable and robust solutions, developing those services in the most appropriate language (Python, Golang) according to best practices.

Some of the current challenges we are working on right now:
We’re building a modern microservices-based infrastructure running in multiple availability regions.
Data warehouse technology migration - We are growing like never before, with 100% year on year growth. Currently we use a combination of Postgres and Redshift, however we will consider other data warehouse technologies and also re-implement our ELT layer using modern tools.
Building new features for our clients driven by innovation - some of these projects require super high availability and ultra low latency.
Engineering at Ometria

We believe in modern software engineering principles, including DevOps and SRE practices, little ‘a’ Agile (including Kanban and friends), delighting our users and investing in the growth of our team.

The engineering team is currently 25 engineers (looking to double this year across the two offices) - frontend, backend, SRE, and test. We have varied backgrounds in terms of experience, roles and responsibilities and all work in the same office. We work closely with our product team on new features, infrastructure, growth, and client-specific work.


Our tech stack:

Our clients interact with the Ometria platform through a single page web app, which uses the Ampersand.js framework, with a separate section in React.

The app communicates with the backend platform through various Python 3 and Golang. Flask powers our Python API layer. Golang powers some of our massively concurrent workloads and analytics services.

We run on AWS/Docker/Kubernetes configured with Terraform. Data is stored in Postgres and Redshift, and we use various queueing/messaging tools (Google Pub/Sub, Kinesis, AWS SQS, Beanstalk, Celery, and Gearman)


What kind of experience are we looking for?
Experience
You have written software at scale in either Python or Golang or another open source language and you are looking to learn Python.
Problem solver
You enjoy working collaboratively in a team, but can also work independently to solve complex problems. You seek help/feedback when required to ensure solutions are robust, performant, secure, etc… utilising product managers, test engineers and SRE’s.

Why join Ometria?

One of our values is “It's awesome to be here”, here are some of the reasons we love working here:

We’ve grown to lead our industry, becoming the biggest (and favourite) will-writer in the UK. What’s more, we’ve raised over £200M in charity legacy donations, and been recognised as the national will writing firm of the year at the wills and probate industry awards.

In the last 9 months we’ve launched and scaled two new products helping families with probate and more recently cremation, with outstanding customer reviews.

We're a diverse, close-knit team of 80 at the forefront of legal technology, playing a crucial role in modernising important legal services, in order to provide best in class customer experiences at the times our customers need it most.

We have 13 Engineers at Farewill currently, and we’re looking to grow our Engineering team as we build out more cross-functional product teams. Our applications are built largely using Node.js and React, with a blend of JavaScript and TypeScript.

This is an amazing opportunity to build best-in-class products whilst growing your skills and experience as part of a diverse, high-performing yet supportive environment.

Our tech


Our applications are written in ES6 JavaScript and TypeScript, and our stack includes React, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. You don't need experience with all of the technologies we use – we're keen to hear from people from different backgrounds!

On the frontend we're using React with styled-components and our internal component library. Our website is powered by Gatsby, and throughout our applications we use React hooks and Redux to manage state.

For the backend we run on Node, serving Express APIs. Across our applications, we use PostgreSQL and MongoDB as our primary data stores.

Our codebases use ESLint, Prettier, Mocha and Jest to automate testing. We push to GitHub, test on CircleCI and deploy (continuously) to Heroku.

Who you are:


You’re a software engineer who is interested in working across the stack, from giving design input to managing deployments.

You’re motivated by building great products that solve real problems, whether it’s making our customers’ lives better in difficult situations, enabling our own team through great tooling or improving website conversion metrics. You care about the quality of the work you produce, aiming to make it stable, maintainable and easy to work with for the rest of the Farewill team.

You’re keen to work collaboratively and are able to communicate potentially complicated and technical concepts in ways that make it easy for other disciplines to understand. In the areas you don’t have much prior experience, you’re excited by the prospect of getting stuck in and learning something new.

As an engineer in our team, over the next 12 months, you’ll:
Join one of our multidisciplinary agile teams to build web applications, focussed on one of:
scaling and extending our wills products
building internal tooling to support our legal teams
launching a new product

Play an active role in our code review process, reviewing code from across the team as well as making it easy for others to review the code you write.
Write and maintain tests throughout our codebases.
Help out with at least one user testing session.
Share your knowledge/experience/interests with the team – be it through pairing, a company passion talk or external speaking opportunity.

We are looking for Infrastructure Engineers who are passionate about working with cutting-edge technologies, bring deep technical knowledge and experience.

Infrastructure Engineering is an engineering discipline that combines software and systems engineering to build and support large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems.

Much of our software development focuses on optimising existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. As Infrastructure Engineers are responsible for the big picture of how we manage cloud based environments, we use a breadth of tools and approaches to solve a broad spectrum of problems. Practices such as limiting time spent on operational work, blameless post-mortems and proactive identification of potential outages factor into iterative improvement that is key to both product quality and interesting and dynamic day-to-day work.

Infrastructure Engineering’s culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organisation brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment.

Software Engineer (Core),£29K-£39K (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company

Grakn Labs is a team of people driven by a purpose: to solve the world's most complex problems, through knowledge engineering. We are the inventors of the Grakn knowledge-base and the Graql query language. Our technology helps organisations in various industries, including Life Sciences, Defence & Security, Financial Services and Robotics, to build intelligent systems that we believe will change the world. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery, our technology empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of complexity in knowledge, and solve the world's most complex problems.

In 2017, we were awarded Product of the Year by the University of Cambridge. After only a few years, our pioneering community has grown to 5K+ engineers, spread across 10+ countries around the globe -- and we're still counting. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.

Software Engineer (Core), Senior/Lead

As a Software Engineer (Core) at Grakn Labs, you will be building a distributed database - Grakn, the query language - Graql, and all the technology infrastructure in the organisation.

Grakn is a distributed knowledge graph: a logical database that allows you to organise large and complex networks of data as one body of knowledge. Grakn provides the knowledge engineering tools for developers to easily leverage the power of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning when building complex systems. Ultimately, Grakn serves as the knowledge-base foundation for cognitive and intelligent systems.

Graql is Grakn's query language. It provides an expressive knowledge schema language through an enhanced entity-relationship model, transactional queries that perform deductive reasoning in real-time, and analytical queries with native distributed Pregel and MapReduce algorithms. Graql provides a strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complex relationships.

Graql is distributed as an open-source technology, while Grakn comes in two forms: Grakn Core - which is also open-source, and Grakn KGMS - our enterprise Knowledge Graph Management Service, available through Google Cloud and Amazon AWS.

Under-the-hood, our technology is built with open-source and distributed technology stacks: from ANTLR to TinkerPop, Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, Akka, gRPC, Bazel, and Kubernetes. We are also still evolving the Grakn architecture to be even more scalable and we'll be adopting new frameworks that could revolutionise our performance. Our main (back-end) development language is Java, but we also provide our database client drivers in Python and Node.js as well, and we intended to support the top 10 languages. We automate our entire build and release pipeline, and we treat them as a first-class citizen in our work and architecture.

Your work as a Software Engineer (Core) will span across all aspects of software engineering; from programming and debugging, to architecture design, build engineering, release engineering, documentation, workflow automation, PRs & code reviews, as well as R&D. Your goal is to build the most intelligent, powerful, scalable and simple database of our generation.

Culture

You will be joining a team that cares deeply not just about the intelligence of the code, but also the elegance and simplicity of the solution. We have a strong sense of urgency, but we always know ""why"" something needs to be developed, and we make sure that we work purposefully. Although we are expected to be independent in the common engineering tasks, we collaborate in perfecting our ideas and solutions. Every time we have an opportunity to change our workflow, infrastructure or architecture to improve our technology performance, user experience or developer productivity, we take that opportunity, and we grow.

Senior Software Engineer,£29K-£39K (Glassdoor Est.),"About the team

Bulb is here to help our members cut their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. Our product teams make that happen. We’re developing products that will deliver the future of energy - from using AI to read energy meters, to making carbon offsetting fun and simple, from finding out how to get the most from Smart Meter data to helping people get paid for their solar energy. We also power the sign-up journey that helped us become the fastest growing company in the UK and the internal tools that let us deliver an excellent Trust Pilot score.

We work in project-based sprints in integrated teams and encourage an open and transparent working environment.

The following pods are hiring Senior Software Engineers:

Smart

Own end to end technology behind Smart meter experience - installation, onboarding, data consumption, and energy usage advice. Integration with smart home appliances is likely the future as well.

Innovation
Solar: Developing new tools and features to help members with solar panels to save money and get paid for the energy that the export to the grid.
EV charging: helping members with Electric Vehicles save and reduce their carbon emissions by charging at the cheapest and greenest times of day. Investigating future technologies like vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid (i.e. using your car battery to store extra renewable energy to use later).
Batteries: Helping members with solar panels store excess solar energy for use when the sun has gone down.
Requirements

At Bulb we want to hire people with the experiences necessary to get going quickly, but who are also interested in learning new things and are comfortable working in a changing environment.
You take pleasure from clear code, see writing tests as an integral part of the development process and understand the benefit of writing code and tests in small increments.
You are keen to learn new technologies and have ideas about how we do things better.
You like solving both real world and technical problems.
You are an enthusiastic team player who enjoys collaborating across teams and departments.
You are passionate about learning and personal growth.
The Stack

At Bulb we use a wide variety of technologies. While we have core technologies that we work with, we're always trying to pick the best tool for the job, and are always looking at what's on the horizon.
Our stack currently includes:
Node, Typescript, Koa, GraphQL, React, React Native, Webpack, Babel
Circle CI, Kubernetes, Docker and Google Cloud Platform
We use Git for source control, write tests and run continuous integration, and review each other’s code through pull requests.

Ideally, you would be familiar with these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Typescript/Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we’re more interested in your broad experience of software development than of specific tools or libraries. You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms. You should be pragmatic and experienced enough to know when a different choice of technology would be more suitable, and comfortable leading explorations into new technologies.

Team Structure

Teams at Bulb are cross-functional, self-organized and autonomous pods.
You’ll be working within a growing cross functional team composed of specialists with backgrounds in DevOps, Engineering and Security.
We practice Scrum/Kanban and work lean.
Work is not siloed, you’re able to commit across the stack, and you have a view of all the features the teams are working on.
We use data to drive continuous improvement in our development process and we review this data in our fortnightly retrospectives.
Benefits
Be part of a growing technology startup and help shape the future of energy.
33 days holiday a year (including bank holidays) and the option to buy up to 5 more.
After a year at Bulb, you can take an additional month of unpaid leave to travel, work on personal projects or simply to recharge and reboot.
12 weeks of full pay for maternity, paternity or adoption leave.
Every team member has the option to buy shares in Bulb at a later date, at a discounted price. We all own a bit of Bulb.

Since we launched in 2017, we’ve been on a mission to make everyone, starting with our awesome Plumsters, financially better off �� We do this by helping them automate their savings, avoid overpaying on bills, and providing a simple platform for them to invest, if they’d like to try and grow their money for the future ��

The social aspect of what we do is also really important to us. We’re trying to change things for the better, by helping our users fight against a confusing financial system that is stacked against the most vulnerable in society (such as those on low income or the elderly) ��

Specifically, here’s what we’re trying to tackle:
11.5m people in the UK have less than £100 in savings
90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation
£4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year
2/3 of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know.
In three years, we've grown from 2 co-founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 45, with offices in London and Athens.

Now, with more than 900,000 people already using Plum, we are looking for a talented Sr Software Engineer with experience in a fintech environment!

Engineering at Plum

Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds (physics, computer science, music, even history!) and we welcome all levels of experience. We value good engineering principles and healthy curiosity. We take a conservative approach to using external frameworks and we aspire to write simple, well-tested code, delivered in rapid iterations.

We currently operate a Python monolith on a large Kubernetes cluster (with automatic scaling to smooth our traffic) on Google Cloud Platform and wrangle ~1TB of data in Postgres and BigQuery. You'll get to work on bank data ingestion, payments, investments, data pipelines, user-facing features and our in-house chat framework (think NLP). On top, you'll play an integral role in taking Plum's infrastructure to an exciting next level – a suite of fault-tolerant, self-contained backend services.

How We Work

We work in ""squads"" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams. Each squad has a mission and a set of KPIs to monitor and improve. We have 3 of these squads right now – Savings, Investments and Black Ops. As an engineer you'll work in a squad but you can also reach out to and work with anyone in the company.

Our Culture: Openness & Accountability

Even though you'll have a primary role, you can get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in and contribute feedback and product ideas freely. In return, we'll expect you to back your decisions with data and logic. Features are considered finished when the data tells us that they've moved the needle.

What We Look For

Technical knowledge is critical but we are a startup treading in uncharted territory so attitude is even more important. We're looking for people that like uncertainty and want to figure out how to do things that haven’t been done before. You're a true team player and inherently positive. Where others see problems, you see solutions.

Value You'll Bring

As a Senior Fintech Engineer, you have worked in critical parts of payments systems, you understand transactions, how different payment methods work and value security while not being afraid on getting your hands dirty and enhancing a complex fintech system.
You have 5+ years of experience as a backend engineer
You have at least 2 years of experience working in tech for the financial sector
You have worked in various tech projects where product, compliance and engineers are stakeholders
Familiarity with Python is a plus
Plum's Perks
Join one of the hottest fintech start-up in London ����
We're all in this together! Own part of the company through stock options ��
Flexibility to work from our Athens office (almost) whenever you want ����
25 days holiday a year, excluding bank holidays (33 in total)
Our annual team trip, to a secret destination ✈️
An office brimming with fruit & snacks, coffee, plants, and a vibe that’s... ������

Forward Deployed Software Engineer,£29K-£39K (Glassdoor Est.),"A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.
Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.
Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.
Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.
Python for data processing and analysis.
Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.
Our Principles
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.
Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics or relevant experience.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Willingness and interest to travel as needed.

Senior Software Engineer (Backend),£29K-£39K (Glassdoor Est.),"At Zoopla we want to help everyone make intelligent home buying decisions. We are building a team that will have the once in a career opportunity to re-imagine our industry.

The interesting stuff…
You will have spent lots of quality time with your IDE of choice, deeply learning the powerful idioms and important idiosyncrasies of multiple programming languages and their ecosystems. We like to code mostly in Golang, Python, Node.js / JavaScript, .NET Core and Perl here, but we’re open to all.
You will ideally know AWS as well as you know your best friend, although it’s great if you’re good friends with other cloud services, too.
You will have diligently practiced your engineering craft, mastering your skills in techniques such as TDD, refactoring, clean code and pair programming.
You will have implemented CI pipelines and automation, championed the quality and deployment benefits of both to others.
The product(s) you’ve built will have delighted users (perhaps millions of them!) while being stable, performant, observable and supportable.
If you’ve played a role in designing and implementing new architectures and technical strategies, while also looking after existing technology real estate, you’ll fit in great.
Importantly, if you’re looking for a senior role with us, you will have achieved many of the things above while also teaching others, influencing your team and organisation, and maybe even sharing your journey and knowledge publicly.
Why Zoopla…
We're serious about tech but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
We believe in the value of data. We run a team that is data informed. We think being data-driven is soulless and dangerous. Clean, confident, clear data combined with the insights of the team is what drives our decisions.
We want to build small, collaborative, cross-functional teams that push each other to create elegant, simple solutions to difficult customer problems.
No matter what the role we want everyone to be obsessed with getting inside the minds of our customers.
How do you know we’re the best place for you?
You strive to set the standard and are always looking to raise the bar and want to be surrounded by others who do so as well
You enjoy knowing your customer
You want to build things together, collaboratively with your team
You want to own it; to have ownership and accountability for the outcomes of your effort
You value sharing and committing to discussions and debates with your teammates

We are based in New York, London, and remote. As we prepare to release our first product in late 2020, we are looking to hire software engineers to join our team in London. If you enjoy working in an open team environment and are excited to tackle new and interesting problems while building quality software, do read on to find out more!

What problem are you trying to solve?


Think about how easy it is for you to purchase something online; you can see various options, filter by different features, and then once ordered, track where your delivery is until it arrives at your doorstep.

It might surprise you that such systems do not yet exist for manufacturers or suppliers who are looking to buy or sell raw material, such as aluminium, copper or cocoa. Thanks to many challenges involved, particularly due to the size of the market, such purchases are currently extremely manual.. using a combination of emails, phone calls, text messages to track purchases, sales and deliveries.

What are you doing?
We are bringing market intelligent and pricing tools to small and big manufacturers and producers of physical commodities to maximise value for the end customers.
By providing financing, price discovery and other facilities we are creating a a fairer more transparent marketplace and enabling companies to trade with new counterparties.
We are improving logistic and tracking of commodities around the world. This mean optimised delivery routes, with benefits such as a reduction in carbon footprint.
Where are you now? Who is the team?


Best way to describe us is a well-funded early stage start-up. We raised a Series A of $10mm in September 2019 and have a team with background in both technology and commodities. We are currently working on delivering a first product to our customers by late 2020.

We have tech experts who have built systems that handle millions of transactions per second. They are bringing a completely new level of expertise to the old-fashioned world of commodity technology.

We have commodity experts, with 56 years of experience in the space. They have a deep knowledge of the current market structure and understand the challenges our customers face day to day.

Where are you based?


We currently have offices in London and New York, and also have people who work remotely. For this particular position, you would be working closely with the team in London.

Would I fit in?


We will try our best to make sure you feel at home at CMDTY. Our co-founders genuinely believe that a diverse team will set us up for success and as such we are working hard to attract diverse candidates who can add value right from the start, but also grow and thrive further in CMDTY.

We are currently a team of 17 from many different nationalities and races, including 8 women, with a 50/50 men/women split in the technology area. A lot of the team has children, so we think CMDTY is super family friendly. We will help you handle the challenges that come along with having a family.

Do I need Commodity experience?


No, and you don't even need to care that much about commodities to find this space fascinating. Our team includes a former commodities quant who will quickly get you up to speed. We are also working on an internal series of ""learn and teach"" classes so we can teach each other about various topics.

OK, I am excited, what are you actually after?


In short, we are looking for individuals who are excited to tackle the problems we described above.

You will be working closely with our head of quantitative analysis and data science to implement some core components of the deal intelligence, logistics optimisation, pricing and risk engines. These are the algorithms that will be at the core of our product offering.

You will also be working with our CTO and the rest of the technology team in a highly collaborative and transparent environment. You should be excited to solve interesting engineering problems, help establish well-designed engineering processes and ship high quality enterprise level product.

Given where we are now, you will be able to start building and contributing from day one, and help build the architecture for our systems. As the team grows, you will have more junior developers that you can nurture and develop too.

What is your technology stack?
Python REST API and GraphQL
React, Redux, Relay, and Typescript.
AWS, Kubernetes, Docker.
Automated CI/CD with staging and production environments.
Postgres.
How Senior is the role? What experience do I need?


If you can think you can contribute, you should apply, and we will compensate you based on your experience and ability. If you are intrigued by the role and are excited to work in our stack, then you should probably apply.

Tell me one more time why CMDTY is great?
We are handling real material that is used by almost all of us on a daily basis. We will be tracking trucks and ships and facilitate purchases of solid pieces of metal. We think that's cool.
We are a start-up, with a start-up culture. We will move and build things quickly, and every team member will have a real impact on where we go and what we build.
But we are well-funded, so we pay market rates.
You get to work with our founding team who have a proven track record.

We’ve grown to lead our industry, becoming the biggest (and favourite) will-writer in the UK. What’s more, we’ve raised over £200M in charity legacy donations, and been recognised as the national will writing firm of the year at the wills and probate industry awards.

In the last 9 months we’ve launched and scaled two new products helping families with probate and more recently cremation, with outstanding customer reviews.

We're a diverse, close-knit team of 80 at the forefront of legal technology, playing a crucial role in modernising important legal services, in order to provide best in class customer experiences at the times our customers need it most.

We have 13 Engineers at Farewill currently, and we’re looking to grow our Engineering team as we build out more cross-functional product teams. Our applications are built largely using Node.js and React, with a blend of JavaScript and TypeScript.

This is an amazing opportunity to build best-in-class products whilst growing your skills and experience as part of a diverse, high-performing yet supportive environment.

Our tech


Our applications are written in ES6 JavaScript and TypeScript, and our stack includes React, Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. You don't need experience with all of the technologies we use – we're keen to hear from people from different backgrounds!

On the frontend we're using React with styled-components and our internal component library. Our website is powered by Gatsby, and throughout our applications we use React hooks and Redux to manage state.

For the backend we run on Node, serving Express APIs. Across our applications, we use PostgreSQL and MongoDB as our primary data stores.

Our codebases use ESLint, Prettier, Mocha and Jest to automate testing. We push to GitHub, test on CircleCI and deploy (continuously) to Heroku.

You care about the quality of the work you produce, aiming to make it stable, maintainable and easy to work with for the rest of the Farewill team.

You’re keen to work collaboratively and are able to communicate potentially complicated and technical concepts in ways that make it easy for other disciplines to understand. In the areas you don’t have much prior experience, you’re excited by the prospect of getting stuck in and learning something new.

As an engineer in our team, over the next 12 months, you’ll:
Join one of our multidisciplinary agile teams to build web applications, focussed on one of:
scaling and extending our wills products
building internal tooling to support our legal teams

Play an active role in our code review process, reviewing code from across the team as well as making it easy for others to review the code you write.
Write and maintain tests throughout our codebases.
Help out with at least one user testing session.
Share your knowledge/experience/interests with the team – be it through pairing, a company passion talk or external speaking opportunity.

Description


Canonical and Ubuntu are at the forefront of cloud and IoT computing, helping customers master the challenge of operations on hybrid cloud, bare metal, and container-based systems. Our Field Engineers are at the heart of this process, demonstrating, designing and delivering exciting solutions to a range of customers, from startups to Fortune 500s.

If traveling around the globe and working with some of the smartest people in the industry sounds appealing, and if you like to dig into the code, Canonical might be the place you are looking for!

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES

Canonical's Field Engineering division is unique in its approach with customers: we engage early on in the pre-sales process and remain engaged throughout the delivery phase. This approach creates exciting dynamics in which one is involved in various customer facing processes; going to sales events and providing engineering support to the sales team, designing solutions for customers and in the end implementing those solutions.

This requires unique skills, both technical and non-technical. TCP/IP networking, libvirt/KVM virtualization and core Linux operating system skills are a must-have in the course of discussing detailed architecture, designing complex solutions and guiding customers to successful infrastructure operations. Most of our team's solutions are based on OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Ubuntu; therefore the ideal candidate has interest and experience with one or more of these.

Most of us work from home and that brings a perk of defining our own schedule and working hours. Everybody dictates their own pace and works in the environment that works best for them.When we are not with customers, we let our imagination shine. This is when we use our coding skills to improve the products and tools that we deliver to our customers.

Being a very spread out company, we don't get to share office space, but every now and then we meet somewhere in the world and have a great time. This is when our diversity really shines. Come join us and enrich our diversity even more!

BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field

Software Engineer (Core),-1,"The Company

Grakn Labs is a team of people driven by a purpose: to solve the world's most complex problems, through knowledge engineering. We are the inventors of the Grakn knowledge-base and the Graql query language. Our technology helps organisations in various industries, including Life Sciences, Defence & Security, Financial Services and Robotics, to build intelligent systems that we believe will change the world. From financial analytics to drug discovery, cyber threat detection to robotics disaster recovery, our technology empowers engineers around the world to tackle a higher order of complexity in knowledge, and solve the world's most complex problems.

In 2017, we were awarded Product of the Year by the University of Cambridge. After only a few years, our pioneering community has grown to 5K+ engineers, spread across 10+ countries around the globe -- and we're still counting. To continue pursuing this vision, we need to build a team of individuals who are not just the best and brightest in what they do, but also driven by a strong sense of purpose and compassion for the world.

Software Engineer (Core), Senior/Lead

As a Software Engineer (Core) at Grakn Labs, you will be building a distributed database - Grakn, the query language - Graql, and all the technology infrastructure in the organisation.

Grakn is a distributed knowledge graph: a logical database that allows you to organise large and complex networks of data as one body of knowledge. Grakn provides the knowledge engineering tools for developers to easily leverage the power of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning when building complex systems. Ultimately, Grakn serves as the knowledge-base foundation for cognitive and intelligent systems.

Graql is Grakn's query language. It provides an expressive knowledge schema language through an enhanced entity-relationship model, transactional queries that perform deductive reasoning in real-time, and analytical queries with native distributed Pregel and MapReduce algorithms. Graql provides a strong abstraction over low-level data constructs and complex relationships.

Graql is distributed as an open-source technology, while Grakn comes in two forms: Grakn Core - which is also open-source, and Grakn KGMS - our enterprise Knowledge Graph Management Service, available through Google Cloud and Amazon AWS.

Under-the-hood, our technology is built with open-source and distributed technology stacks: from ANTLR to TinkerPop, Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra, Akka, gRPC, Bazel, and Kubernetes. We are also still evolving the Grakn architecture to be even more scalable and we'll be adopting new frameworks that could revolutionise our performance. Our main (back-end) development language is Java, but we also provide our database client drivers in Python and Node.js as well, and we intended to support the top 10 languages. We automate our entire build and release pipeline, and we treat them as a first-class citizen in our work and architecture.

Your work as a Software Engineer (Core) will span across all aspects of software engineering; from programming and debugging, to architecture design, build engineering, release engineering, documentation, workflow automation, PRs & code reviews, as well as R&D. Your goal is to build the most intelligent, powerful, scalable and simple database of our generation.

Culture

You will be joining a team that cares deeply not just about the intelligence of the code, but also the elegance and simplicity of the solution. We have a strong sense of urgency, but we always know ""why"" something needs to be developed, and we make sure that we work purposefully. Although we are expected to be independent in the common engineering tasks, we collaborate in perfecting our ideas and solutions. Every time we have an opportunity to change our workflow, infrastructure or architecture to improve our technology performance, user experience or developer productivity, we take that opportunity, and we grow.

VB Software Engineer,-1,"Company Description

Titian Software specialises in software for sample management. We offer software products that help most of the market-leading, and a growing number of small pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies to improve the supply of samples (compounds, biologicals and reagents) to their vital research processes.

Creating and enhancing such a software solution is a challenging task. It involves constant learning, great algorithmic complexity and variety, and tricky performance considerations. We use Scrum, and are very quality-conscious, with peer-reviews, unit- and manual integration tests (done mainly by dedicated testers) and clearly defined but always improving procedures and guidelines. We have a growing DevOps culture to optimise the pipeline and are always open to suggestions for improvements.

While we may not be at the front line, we are proud to serve an industry which makes a real difference to people's lives throughout the world.

Job Description

The team

Our product consists of a diverse set of components, including front and back end technologies. Since customer requirements are always evolving, our Scrum teams have the opportunity to work with a varied set of technologies and code base. This vacancy is within a Titian Software Scrum team specialising in desktop applications integrating with automated liquid handlers from a multitude of hardware vendors. The team will be developing new enhancements to a mature VB6 application crucial to many large pharmaceuticals and bio-tech companies, and assist with longer term modernising of the application.

You will join a Scrum team with 3-5 other developers and a tester. At least one of the developers or the team leader is very experienced (5+ years) and helps with the designs and maintaining the quality via code reviews. For the customer requirements, the team can rely on experienced (often 10+ years) application consultants knowing the customer processes.

Our developers and application consultants come from different backgrounds (software engineering, natural/applied sciences, pharmaceutical) and different countries. With flexible working hours, remote working options, casual dress code and frequent social events, this creates a friendly atmosphere to work in.

The challenge

We have a single product, but thanks to the modular architecture, we can extend our core functionalities effortlessly to provide even more robust and meaningful solutions for our customers. This, however, requires an initial challenging design to make the change the most optimal that helps the most customers.

The pharmaceutical/biotech sector is very sensitive to quality, as they are doing expensive and high-throughput operations. Naturally, code quality is a major metric for us, and we are armed with a set of useful procedures and guidelines that everyone adheres and contributes to. We also have a product that is built robustly to handle errors from external sources or events safely and gracefully.

Aside from quality, our customers are also very security-oriented. This was even more of a challenge when we recently started a SAAS offering on an AWS infrastructure. We started with only a set of packages offered this way and are slowly extending this to the whole product range.

Putting these together gives enough delightful challenge even for the most experienced developers.

The process

Our projects usually start with requirements we get from customers that our application consultants and software team members analyse and break down into gaps. The scrum team working on the project breaks this down to further functional user stories. We keep the customer updated throughout the process, and often give them periodical releases they test and move into production. Before releases, we do in-house UAT execution of the whole business processes (essentially a FAT). For the actual releases, members of the scrum team often go to customer sites to supervise the first testing, especially when we integrate with a new machine, robotic platform or external software system. We have a very good track record of projects finished on time, to budget and to the customer's satisfaction, and we invite you to join this success story!

The opportunities

Our software engineers have the opportunity to progress on a technical track (Senior Software Engineer with e.g. tech lead role), a management track (Software Team Leader with e.g. project manager role) or a consultant track (Application Consultant with client-facing roles), dependent on their interest. Since we are a small company, people can also define their ideal roles and we do all we can to provide it to them.

Qualifications

We'd like you to be on the team, if you like good algorithmic challenges, can produce quality code, have experience with relational databases and Visual Basic 6. We also prefer candidates with at least one year of commercial experience. It's a plus if you have experience with C#/.NET, ASP/ASP.NET. Drop us an email, come to an interview and see for yourself!

Additional Information

We provide a friendly, supportive, well-organised environment, with good work-life balance and opportunities for self-improvement. Oh, and we also have Friday cookies and fresh fruits throughout the week! Our teams work partly remotely.

Senior Software Engineer,-1,"About the team

Bulb is here to help our members cut their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. Our product teams make that happen. We’re developing products that will deliver the future of energy - from using AI to read energy meters, to making carbon offsetting fun and simple, from finding out how to get the most from Smart Meter data to helping people get paid for their solar energy. We also power the sign-up journey that helped us become the fastest growing company in the UK and the internal tools that let us deliver an excellent Trust Pilot score.

We work in project-based sprints in integrated teams and encourage an open and transparent working environment.

The following pods are hiring Senior Software Engineers:

Smart

Own end to end technology behind Smart meter experience - installation, onboarding, data consumption, and energy usage advice. Integration with smart home appliances is likely the future as well.

Innovation
Solar: Developing new tools and features to help members with solar panels to save money and get paid for the energy that the export to the grid.
EV charging: helping members with Electric Vehicles save and reduce their carbon emissions by charging at the cheapest and greenest times of day. Investigating future technologies like vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid (i.e. using your car battery to store extra renewable energy to use later).
Batteries: Helping members with solar panels store excess solar energy for use when the sun has gone down.
Requirements

At Bulb we want to hire people with the experiences necessary to get going quickly, but who are also interested in learning new things and are comfortable working in a changing environment.
You take pleasure from clear code, see writing tests as an integral part of the development process and understand the benefit of writing code and tests in small increments.
You are keen to learn new technologies and have ideas about how we do things better.
You like solving both real world and technical problems.
You are an enthusiastic team player who enjoys collaborating across teams and departments.
You are passionate about learning and personal growth.
The Stack

At Bulb we use a wide variety of technologies. While we have core technologies that we work with, we're always trying to pick the best tool for the job, and are always looking at what's on the horizon.
Our stack currently includes:
Node, Typescript, Koa, GraphQL, React, React Native, Webpack, Babel
Circle CI, Kubernetes, Docker and Google Cloud Platform
We use Git for source control, write tests and run continuous integration, and review each other’s code through pull requests.

Ideally, you would be familiar with these technologies or similar patterns; notably, Typescript/Javascript coupled with React is a core technology for us. But we’re more interested in your broad experience of software development than of specific tools or libraries. You should be comfortable getting up-to-speed quickly in new tools and platforms. You should be pragmatic and experienced enough to know when a different choice of technology would be more suitable, and comfortable leading explorations into new technologies.

Team Structure

Teams at Bulb are cross-functional, self-organized and autonomous pods.
You’ll be working within a growing cross functional team composed of specialists with backgrounds in DevOps, Engineering and Security.
We practice Scrum/Kanban and work lean.
Work is not siloed, you’re able to commit across the stack, and you have a view of all the features the teams are working on.
We use data to drive continuous improvement in our development process and we review this data in our fortnightly retrospectives.
Benefits
Be part of a growing technology startup and help shape the future of energy.
33 days holiday a year (including bank holidays) and the option to buy up to 5 more.
After a year at Bulb, you can take an additional month of unpaid leave to travel, work on personal projects or simply to recharge and reboot.
12 weeks of full pay for maternity, paternity or adoption leave.
Every team member has the option to buy shares in Bulb at a later date, at a discounted price. We all own a bit of Bulb.
Activities to improve your mental and physical well being including office yoga and meditation.

Senior Software Engineer (Backend),£51K-£61K (Glassdoor Est.),"At Zoopla we want to help everyone make intelligent home buying decisions. We are building a team that will have the once in a career opportunity to re-imagine our industry.

The interesting stuff…
You will have spent lots of quality time with your IDE of choice, deeply learning the powerful idioms and important idiosyncrasies of multiple programming languages and their ecosystems. We like to code mostly in Golang, Python, Node.js / JavaScript, .NET Core and Perl here, but we’re open to all.
You will ideally know AWS as well as you know your best friend, although it’s great if you’re good friends with other cloud services, too.
You will have diligently practiced your engineering craft, mastering your skills in techniques such as TDD, refactoring, clean code and pair programming.
You will have implemented CI pipelines and automation, championed the quality and deployment benefits of both to others.
The product(s) you’ve built will have delighted users (perhaps millions of them!) while being stable, performant, observable and supportable.
If you’ve played a role in designing and implementing new architectures and technical strategies, while also looking after existing technology real estate, you’ll fit in great.
Importantly, if you’re looking for a senior role with us, you will have achieved many of the things above while also teaching others, influencing your team and organisation, and maybe even sharing your journey and knowledge publicly.
Why Zoopla…
We're serious about tech but we don't take ourselves too seriously.
We are spiritually agile, not religiously agile.
We strongly believe in the value of good design. We believe it is a primary differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
We believe in the value of data. We run a team that is data informed. We think being data-driven is soulless and dangerous. Clean, confident, clear data combined with the insights of the team is what drives our decisions.
We want to build small, collaborative, cross-functional teams that push each other to create elegant, simple solutions to difficult customer problems.
No matter what the role we want everyone to be obsessed with getting inside the minds of our customers.
How do you know we’re the best place for you?
You strive to set the standard and are always looking to raise the bar and want to be surrounded by others who do so as well
You enjoy knowing your customer
You want to build things together, collaboratively with your team
You want to own it; to have ownership and accountability for the outcomes of your effort
You value sharing and committing to discussions and debates with your teammates

Full Stack Engineer,£51K-£61K (Glassdoor Est.),"About Sano
Sano is a software platform that matches people with medical research, and provides personalised insights and recommendations based on their data. The platform is private by design, and puts users in full control over their data.

To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We started Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts people at the centre.

We have built a software platform that matches people with medical research, and provides personalised recommendations and insights based on their data.

The platform is private and user-centric by design - we think people should be in control of their sensitive health data and choose who can access it. We also offer at-home DNA testing, which means that people can participate much more conveniently and researchers can run their studies faster, at-lower cost, globally, and reach participants who might not otherwise be able to join.

Today, the Sano platform helps thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines, and to access personalised reports based on their genetic data.

Over the next year, we are expanding our product to be a 'patient portal' for national scale precision medicine initiatives (e.g. Genomics England) with the potential to impact millions of people.

We are a team of 12 people today, so this is an exceptional chance to join early in our journey to help define our culture, and the company’s mission.

What you will do

We need a skilled, reliable, and motivated full-stack engineer who can deliver on tasks involving a mix of frontend, backend related skills. For example:
We’d like to build a Content Management System allowing our research team to launch new research studies and personalised reports. You would be responsible for writing the front-end interface and backend endpoints to accept data sent from the client and update the relevant records in the database.
We want to build a system to better automate tracking of DNA test kits that are mailed out to research participants, and you would take the lead on building an API integration with our main service provider. To do this, you need to be proficient at reading and understanding API documentation, implementing endpoints according to this documentation, and making any required database schema changes.
We want to make it easier for people to join Sano and for Sano users to join research. To do this, we need to build API integrations to securely share data with trusted partners (always with the users permission).
Responsibilities
Building robust API integrations with third party services
Writing server code to return data to the client via REST interfaces
Making careful adjustments to our database schema to accurately model the entities and relationships that are essential for our product.
Requirements
Experience in SQL database schema design
Experience in Python programming
Experience working with both a Javascript (ideally Vue) frontend and Python backend (ideally Flask).
Experience in Authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT)
Experience and good habits with Python unit testing
Solid fundamentals in best practices of building REST interfaces.
Experience with the following would be a plus:
Python web frameworks and ORMs e.g. Flask, Peewee, PostgreSQL
Client frameworks and datastores such as Vue.js, Vuex, and VuexORM
Benefits
Opportunity to define the strategic direction for a quickly growing company
Company culture driven by transparency, impact, accountability and curiosity
Flexible / remote working opportunities (please note - the company is currently operating fully remote due to COVID-19 and is committed to do so until at least November 2020, possibly longer. We have experience onboarding new team members remotely and will make sure you are an integral part of the team from day 1!)
Pension plan
Employee share options
25 working days holiday + 8 bank holidays

Forward Deployed Software Engineer,£51K-£61K (Glassdoor Est.),"A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms.
Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing.
Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools.
Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies.
Python for data processing and analysis.
Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3.
Our Principles
Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities—we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.
Requirements
Bachelor’s degree in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics or relevant experience.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.

90% of UK savings accounts pay less than inflation
£4bn lost to the loyalty penalty every year
2/3 of UK adults say money stress has affected the health or wellbeing of someone they know.
In three years, we've grown from 2 co-founders sharing a rusty desk in Soho, to a brilliant, hard-working team of 45, with offices in London and Athens.

Now, with more than 900,000 people already using Plum, we are looking for a talented Sr Software Engineer with experience in a fintech environment!

Engineering at Plum

Our engineers come from a variety of backgrounds (physics, computer science, music, even history!) and we welcome all levels of experience. We value good engineering principles and healthy curiosity. We take a conservative approach to using external frameworks and we aspire to write simple, well-tested code, delivered in rapid iterations.

We currently operate a Python monolith on a large Kubernetes cluster (with automatic scaling to smooth our traffic) on Google Cloud Platform and wrangle ~1TB of data in Postgres and BigQuery. You'll get to work on bank data ingestion, payments, investments, data pipelines, user-facing features and our in-house chat framework (think NLP). On top, you'll play an integral role in taking Plum's infrastructure to an exciting next level – a suite of fault-tolerant, self-contained backend services.

How We Work

We work in ""squads"" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams. Each squad has a mission and a set of KPIs to monitor and improve. We have 3 of these squads right now – Savings, Investments and Black Ops. As an engineer you'll work in a squad but you can also reach out to and work with anyone in the company.

Our Culture: Openness & Accountability

Even though you'll have a primary role, you can get involved in any aspect of the business you're interested in and contribute feedback and product ideas freely. In return, we'll expect you to back your decisions with data and logic. Features are considered finished when the data tells us that they've moved the needle.

What We Look For

Technical knowledge is critical but we are a startup treading in uncharted territory so attitude is even more important. We're looking for people that like uncertainty and want to figure out how to do things that haven’t been done before. You're a true team player and inherently positive. Where others see problems, you see solutions.

Value You'll Bring

As a Senior Fintech Engineer, you have worked in critical parts of payments systems, you understand transactions, how different payment methods work and value security while not being afraid on getting your hands dirty and enhancing a complex fintech system.
You have 5+ years of experience as a backend engineer
You have at least 2 years of experience working in tech for the financial sector
You have worked in various tech projects where product, compliance and engineers are stakeholders
Familiarity with Python is a plus
Plum's Perks
Join one of the hottest fintech start-up in London ����
We're all in this together! Own part of the company through stock options ��
Flexibility to work from our Athens office (almost) whenever you want ����
25 days holiday a year, excluding bank holidays (33 in total)
Our annual team trip, to a secret destination ✈️
An office brimming with fruit & snacks, coffee, plants, and a vibe that’s... ������
If you think this sounds like you, then don’t hesitate to get in touch!

Lead Software Engineer,£32K-£40K (Glassdoor Est.),"Description

CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Hiring at Made Tech continues as usual. Our team are now all working remotely so all interviews will be facilitated remotely too. Hopefully this will still be a good experience for candidates. (feedback welcome)
We're even setup to on-board any new starters remotely should we need to. All our projects are setup to continue remotely as well :)


---------------------------

Salary range is £63,900 - £81k per annum plus a range of excellent benefits. Apply below.

Our Senior Engineer 2s are Tech Leads, Architects, Thought Leaders, Full Stack Engineers, and Consultants. They are our most senior technologist within a customer account representing Made Tech and act as a hands-on CTO across one or more software delivery teams driving organisational change and outcomes for users. They combine technical excellence, drive to deliver, and coaching, to achieve outcomes for our customers and their users, and to establish strong engineering cultures within our customers organisations. They find themselves working on a variety of different problems from monoliths to microservices, upskilling colleagues and customers, always finding themselves learning from others, while constantly striving to be nice humans :)

What does the job entail?

We primarily write and deliver custom software for the public sector. We work across central and local government, as well as in health, and our past lies in the technology startup world. Technical excellence for us isn’t about delivering to feature lists. We place a strong emphasis on outcome-based delivery; ensuring our customer’s goals are understood and achieved with the technology we deploy.

Depending on our customers' needs our Senior 2s may play one or more roles. Sometimes the role is very hands-on and you'll be the most senior engineer on the team delivering software, other times you will play more of a technical architect advising teams and ensuring consistency across multiple deliveries. Further still you may play a strong part in account management and hold relationships with our customers senior staff as a technical adviser.

We need flexible individuals who enjoy a varied workload, are happy to switch between being more and less hands-on, but don't see themselves stepping away from code any time soon. It might be that you're stronger as a Tech Lead or as a Tech Architect, or only have experience in one area, that's okay as long as you have an interest and willingness to broaden your expertise.

Our teams have used Ruby with Rails and Sinatra, ES6 with React and Angular 2, C# with .NET Core. We don’t limit ourselves as a company and we expect all our Engineers to be keen on learning new technologies. Automation is important to our teams, so we make sure there is a CD pipeline set up to build, test, and release many times per day.

High performing software delivery teams need to be empowered to iteratively and rapidly deliver changes all the way through to production. To do this we combine our extensive cloud automation knowledge with DevOps culture.

We've been using AWS from the start and as Advanced Partners are go to experts within the public sector. We use a range of IaaS, PaaS and FaaS depending on the needs of our users, in this case software teams, such as EC2, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes, Heroku, CloudFoundry, Azure App Services, and more. We use VPC and PrivateLink for connecting to on-premise, legacy systems. We also use API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, SES, RDS, and many other services provided by AWS.

We ensure we document our architecture and infrastructure as code, using technologies such as Terraform and OpenAPI. Containerisation is a big part of empowering our teams to develop, deploy and scale their applications, but so too is using AWS Lambda and avoiding the complexity of stateful services altogether. Right tool for the job.

For us, DevOps is about culture rather than roles and titles. Even though this role is for someone with strong DevOps experience, the biggest impact you will have is coaching and helping teams use the platforms you build. You won't be building infrastructure in isolation or charged with deploying other peoples work into production. You'll empower teams with the mantra: you build it, you run it!

We grow a team of polyglot programmers, which you might already consider yourself to be, who are versed in a mix of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, declarative, event-based and aspect-oriented. To create this environment our Senior Engineers need to embrace sharing their knowledge and skills with others, and they need to keep an open mind – we’d love to hear some examples of mentoring, coaching and growing team members. Maybe you will have written some blog posts about your discipline, or perhaps even delivered a talk or two.

Requirements

What experience are we looking for?

While we will look for you to have experience in these things, if you don’t have one of these don’t let that stop you applying.
Working directly with customers and users
Working within multidisciplinary teams with product, design, and technology working within the same cycles
Agile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban
Showcasing and presentation skills

We’re looking for a Software Engineer to join our growing engineering team and help us build out scalable, reliable, performant solutions in our SaaS platform. This role will join our new office to help us scale our engineering team as we grow.


Who are we?

Ometria is a customer marketing platform that helps e-commerce retailers make sense of their customer data. We use big data, predictive analytics and machine learning to help retailers send better, less generic and more personalised messages to their customers. We do this right now for some of the fastest growing retail brands, from Made.com to Hotel Chocolat and for 150 million individual people across the world.

We have offices in London, New York and Southampton, we have raised over £25M from leading VCs like Octopus and Summit and are scaling up the business and the platform. This is presenting many technical challenges in turn providing opportunity to learn, grow and develop. We are in the process of establishing a data centre in the US (New York) - so will be reproducing our infrastructure in a different AWS region.

On this journey to providing a product that really stands out we have grown a team of driven, self-reflective and dedicated Ometrians. We’re committed to finding potential candidates who can grow and flourish here, adding to the team culture.

What will you be doing?

As a Software Engineer, you will be working as part of our combined product and engineering team. You will work collaboratively to design scalable and robust solutions, developing those services in the most appropriate language (Python, Golang) according to best practices.

Some of the current challenges we are working on right now:
We’re building a modern microservices-based infrastructure running in multiple availability regions.
Data warehouse technology migration - We are growing like never before, with 100% year on year growth. Currently we use a combination of Postgres and Redshift, however we will consider other data warehouse technologies and also re-implement our ELT layer using modern tools.
Building new features for our clients driven by innovation - some of these projects require super high availability and ultra low latency.
Engineering at Ometria

We believe in modern software engineering principles, including DevOps and SRE practices, little ‘a’ Agile (including Kanban and friends), delighting our users and investing in the growth of our team.

The engineering team is currently 25 engineers (looking to double this year across the two offices) - frontend, backend, SRE, and test. We have varied backgrounds in terms of experience, roles and responsibilities and all work in the same office. We work closely with our product team on new features, infrastructure, growth, and client-specific work.


Our tech stack:

Our clients interact with the Ometria platform through a single page web app, which uses the Ampersand.js framework, with a separate section in React.

The app communicates with the backend platform through various Python 3 and Golang. Flask powers our Python API layer. Golang powers some of our massively concurrent workloads and analytics services.

We run on AWS/Docker/Kubernetes configured with Terraform. Data is stored in Postgres and Redshift, and we use various queueing/messaging tools (Google Pub/Sub, Kinesis, AWS SQS, Beanstalk, Celery, and Gearman)


What kind of experience are we looking for?
Experience
You have written software at scale in either Python or Golang or another open source language and you are looking to learn Python.
Problem solver
You enjoy working collaboratively in a team, but can also work independently to solve complex problems. You seek help/feedback when required to ensure solutions are robust, performant, secure, etc… utilising product managers, test engineers and SRE’s.

Why join Ometria?

One of our values is “It's awesome to be here”, here are some of the reasons we love working here:
Team of amazing people
We are committed to hiring the right people and maintaining our culture as we grow.
Making sure you’ll have an impact
We’re solving interesting challenges and you’ll have a say in how we solve them.
Supporting learning and development
We’re in this together and want you to become the best and feel supported as you do so. We want all Ometrians to be able to continually learn and grow in their roles.
Going above and beyond to help each other
We’re all part of the bigger picture. We love helping each other to thrive and celebrate success together.

At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow.

Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count.

About You

As a Software Engineer, you champion software quality and technical vision for AND and our clients. As a result, you will need to be able to:
Work on large-scale, multiple industries, eCommerce and enterprise-level software development projects using languages and technologies such as .NET, C#, Java, SpringBoot, JavaScript, Node, React, AWS, MySQL, MongoDB, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and more

We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Experience with IaaS services such as Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, Google Cloud Platform or similar.
Exposure to virtualisation or container technology like Docker and Vagrant
Log management and analysis solutions such as ELK stack, loggly, Splunk, Sumo Logic and monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Nagios, New Relic, Prometheus or similar.

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.
Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.

We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges.

Work on large-scale, multiple industries, eCommerce and enterprise-level software development projects using languages and technologies such as .NET, C#, Java, SpringBoot, JavaScript, Node, React, AWS, MySQL, MongoDB, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes and more

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:
We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy.
There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.
Still sound good? Great! Fill out the short application form below and we’ll be in touch.

Joining AND

From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us:

There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.

Joining AND

There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience.
Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us.
