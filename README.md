# SOFTWARE ENGINEER SALARY ESTIMATOR
This predicts salaries of software engineers in the United Kingdom. This project is inspired by Ken Jee's data science from scratch series https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_...

* Built a model that estimates the salaries of software engineers (MAE K)
* Scrapped up to 1000 job describtions with the aid of python and selenium
* Cleaned the data collected to make it easier to understand
* Performed exploratory data analysis to understand and gain insight from the data, for example London has more software engineering jobs than any city in the whole of the United Kingdom
* Feature engineered job descriptions to understand the importance software engineering tools such as Java, Python etc
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
* Productionized the model by building a client facing API using flask
